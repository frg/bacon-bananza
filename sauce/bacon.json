    "description": "Boss Hog Bacon is hickory smoked and dry cured. Our dry-cured bacon will not shrink like packing house bacon because water isn't added or used in the curing process. We use a time-honored, secret formula and you can certainly tell the difference in taste. Flavorful, thick, and succulent, this bacon is not your average grocery store bacon, which has added water to 'pork up' the weight. We don't add water to our bacon, and no water means no splatter. That's why Bacon Freak bacon is the only bacon you can fry naked! And that's why when you cook a pound of our bacon, you get a pound of bacon! Note: this package contains 14 oz. of uncooked bacon which will yield approximately 14 oz. of cooked bacon. It's 14 oz. of pure bacon awesomeness. Every slice cooks up thick and meaty. Get some! - See more at: http://www.baconfreak.com/boss-hog-style-bacon-hickory-smoked-brown-sugar-cured-pack.html#sthash.dSaO5hiZ.dpuf",
